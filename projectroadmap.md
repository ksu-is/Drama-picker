#Project code example

This project was inspired by Professor Thomas's calcGUI code located on his GitHub account page at https://github.com/dominict/pythonteachingcode. 
The code features use tkinter to display a calculator on a user's desktop. Features such as math imports, a class, and definitions are used. 
This project also features elements from Professor Thomas's KSU scrape code located on his GitHub account page.

The code runs well, and we expect to use the basic structure for our project, while adding our unique code along the way. Given the purposes of this project, I will use the Application frame code to display a 'calculator' on the screen and utilize unique functions rather than importing math.

We also used the quote of the template.
