# Drama-Picker
An app that helps track dramas watched and then randomly selects the next drama to watch from a website. 

This project will feature a phone screen-like application where "buttons" will be shown with different options like "Watched Drama", "Drama Roulette", "Watching", "On Hold", and "Dropped". All of the buttons except "Drama Roulutte" will be lists where the user's input will be added to the lists and shown to the user. "Drama Roulette" will randomly pick dramas from the IMDb website and recommend them to the user.
